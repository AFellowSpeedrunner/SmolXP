# TinyXP
Basically Windows XP condensed down into a small ISO and installation size that can be ran on old low performance computers (at that point it's just Windows Thin PC or Embedded but XP and even smaller? idk man.) or for throw away OSes to do malware stuff on. 

This project's inspiration is from the custom Windows version Tiny10 by [NTDEV](https://twitter.com/NTDEV_).
