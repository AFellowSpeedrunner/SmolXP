# TinyXP
TinyXP is a compact version of Windows XP designed for use on low-performance computers or as a disposable operating system for testing purposes. Its small ISO and installation size make it suitable for use on older computers with limited resources. 

This project was inspired by the custom Windows version Tiny10 and Tiny11 by NTDEV. 

Incredibly, TinyXP is able to run with just 24MB of RAM and 32MB of VRAM.

## A warning.
There is a been a bunch of cloning of my repo (around 600) recently which could be by bots trying to reupload my repo and include malware or something of the sorts. 

**When looking out for my real repo located here: https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/TinyXP make sure that Release 1.1's commit signature is 4e2bb25 or if they even have a release.** 

If they don't have a release or a signature being 4e2bb25 then please quickly look into the account if it's an actual person running the account and not a reuploader bot. If it is a bot, report it and come to this repo instead.
