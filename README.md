# TinyXP
TinyXP is a compact version of Windows XP designed for use on low-performance computers or as a disposable operating system for testing purposes. Its small ISO and installation size make it suitable for use on older computers with limited resources. 

This project was inspired by the custom Windows version Tiny10 by NTDEV. 

Incredibly, TinyXP is able to run with just 24MB of RAM and 32MB of VRAM.

## Known Bugs and Issues
### Activation
TinyXP will expire after 30 days which requires reinstall as activation has been removed from TinyXP.
I am now working to reimplement activation and will release it as soon as possible. A key you can use to activate TinyXP is BBY46-G888F-PKWW6-X4CVD-CGF43. You may need to activate via phone which works with this key.
This key can be entered in the next TinyXP release.
