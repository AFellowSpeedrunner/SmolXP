# TinyXP
TinyXP is a compact version of Windows XP designed for use on low-performance computers or as a disposable operating system for testing purposes. Its small ISO and installation size make it suitable for use on older computers with limited resources. 

This project was inspired by the custom Windows version Tiny10 by NTDEV. 

Incredibly, TinyXP is able to run with just 24MB of RAM and 32MB of VRAM.
