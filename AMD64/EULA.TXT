or a single entity) and Microsoft

Corporation for the Microsoft software 
product identified above, which includes 
computer software and may include associated 
media, printed materials, "online" or 
electronic documentation, and Internet-based 
services ("Product"). An amendment or

addendum to this EULA may accompany the 
Product. YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS 
OF THIS EULA BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR 
OTHERWISE USING THE PRODUCT. IF YOU DO NOT 
AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE PRODUCT; YOU 
MAY RETURN IT TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A 
FULL REFUND.

 1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants you 
the following rights provided that you comply 
with all terms and conditions of this EULA:

 * Installation and use. You may install, 
use, access, display and run one copy of the 
Product on a single computer, such as a 
workstation, terminal or other device 
("Workstation Computer"). The Product may not 
be used by more than two (2) processors at 
any one time on any single Workstation 
Computer. You may permit a maximum of ten 
(10) computers or other electronic devices 
(each a "Device") to connect to the 
Workstation Computer to utilize the services 
of the Product solely for File and Print 
services, Internet Information Services, and 
remote access (including connection sharing 
and telephony services). The ten connection 
maximum includes any indirect connections 
made through "multiplexing" or other software 
or hardware which pools or aggregates 
connections. Except as otherwise permitted by 
the Remote Desktop feature described below, 
you may not use the Product to permit any 
Device to use, access, display or run other 
executable software residing on the 
Workstation Computer, nor may you permit any 
Device to use, access, display, or run the 
Product or Product's

user interface, unless the Device has a 
separate license for the Product. 

 * Mandatory Activation. The license rights 
granted under this EULA are limited to the 
first thirty (30) days after you first 
install the Product unless you supply 
information required to activate your 
licensed copy in the manner described during 
the setup sequence of the Product. You can 
activate the Product through the use of the 
Internet or telephone; toll charges may apply.
You may also need to reactivate the Product 
if you modify your computer hardware or alter 
the Product. There are technological measures 
in this Product that are designed to prevent 
unlicensed use of the Product. Microsoft will 
use those measures to confirm you have a 
legally licensed copy of the Product. If you 
are not using a licensed copy of the Product, 
you are not allowed to install the Product or 
future Product updates. Microsoft will not 
collect any personally identifiable 
information from your Workstation Computer 
during this process. 

 * Storage/Network Use. You may also store 
or install a copy of the Product on a storage 
device, such as a network server, used only 
to install or run the Product on your other 
Workstation Computers over an internal 
network; however, you must acquire and 
dedicate an additional license for each 
separate Workstation Computer on or from 
which the Product is installed, used, 
accessed, displayed or run. A license for the 
Product may not be shared or used 
concurrently on different Workstation 
Computers.

 * Remote Desktop/Remote 
Assistance/NetMeeting. The Product contains 
Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance, and 
NetMeeting technologies that enable the 
Product or applications installed on the 
Workstation Computer (sometimes referred to 
as a host device) to be accessed remotely 
from other Devices. You may use the Product's 
Remote Desktop feature (or other software 
which provides similar functionality for a 
similar purpose) to access a Workstation 
Computer Session from any Device provided you 
acquire a separate Product license for that 
Device. As an exception to this rule, the 
person who is the single primary user of the 
Workstation Computer may access a Workstation 
Computer Session from any Device without 
acquiring an additional Product license for 
that Device. When you are using Remote 
Assistance or NetMeeting (or other software 
which provides similar functionality for a 
similar purpose) you may share a Session with 
other users without any limit on the number 
of Device connections and without acquiring 
additional licenses for the Product. For 
Microsoft and non-Microsoft applications, you 
should consult the license agreement 
accompanying the applicable software or 
contact the applicable licensor to determine 
whether use of the software with Remote 
Desktop, Remote Assistance, or NetMeeting is 
permitted without an additional license. 

 * Storage/Network Use. You may also store 
or install a copy of the Product on a storage 
device, such as a network server, used only 
to install or run the Product on your other 
Workstation Computers over an internal 
network; however, you must acquire and 
dedicate an additional license for each 
separate Workstation Computer on or from 
which the Product is installed, used, 
accessed, displayed or run. Except as 
otherwise permitted by the NetMeeting and 
Remote Assistance features described above, a 
license for the Product may not be shared or 
used concurrently on different Workstation 
Computers. 

 * Reservation of Rights. Microsoft reserves 
all rights not expressly granted to you in 
this EULA.

 2. UPGRADES. To use a Product identified as 
an upgrade, you must first be licensed for 
the product identified by Microsoft as 
eligible for the upgrade. After upgrading, 
you may no longer use the product that formed 
the basis for your upgrade eligibility.

3. AUTOMATIC INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. The 
Product features described below are enabled 
by default to connect via the Internet to 
Microsoft computer systems automatically, 
without separate notice to you. You consent 
to the operation of these features, unless 
you choose to switch them off or not use them.
Microsoft does not obtain personal 
information through any of these features. 
For more information about these features, 
please see your Product documentation, the 
Microsoft online support site, or the privacy 
statement at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?
LinkId=25243>.

 * Windows Update Features. If you connect 
hardware to your Workstation Computer, it may 
not have the drivers needed to communicate 
with that hardware. The Product's update 
feature can obtain the correct drivers from 
Microsoft and install them on your device. 
You can switch this update feature off.

 * Web Content Features. Under the Product's 
default configuration, if you are connected 
to the Internet, several features of the 
Product are enabled by default to retrieve 
content from Microsoft computer systems and 
display it to you. When you activate such a 
feature, it uses standard Internet protocols, 
which transmit the type of operating system, 
browser and language code of your Workstation 
Computer to the Microsoft computer system so 
that the content can be viewed properly from 
your Workstation Computer. These features 
only operate when you activate them, and you 
may choose to switch them off or not use them.
Examples of these features include Windows 
Catalog, Search Assistant, and the Headlines 
and Search features of Help and Support 
Center.

 * Digital Certificates. The Product uses 
digital certificates based on the x.509 
standard. These digital certificates confirm 
the identity of Internet users sending x.509 
standard encrypted information. The Product 
retrieves certificates and updates 
certificate revocation lists. These security 
features operate only when you use the 
Internet.

 * Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update 
feature updates the list of trusted 
certificate authorities. You can switch off 
the Auto Root Update feature.

 * Windows Media Player. Some features of 
Windows Media Player automatically contact 
Microsoft computer systems if you use Windows 
Media Player or specific features of it: 
features that (A) check for new codecs if 
your Workstation Computer does not have the 
correct ones for content you attempt to play 
(this feature may be switched off), and (B) 
check for new versions of Windows Media 
Player (this feature will operate only when 
you are using Windows Media Player).

 * Windows Media Digital Rights Management. 
Content providers are using the digital 
rights management technology for Windows 
Media contained in this Product ('WM-DRM') to 
protect the integrity of their content 
("Secure Content") so that their intellectual 
property, including copyright, in such 
content is not misappropriated. Portions of 
this Product and third party applications 
such as media players use WM-DRM to play 
Secure Content ('WM-DRM Product'). If the WM-
DRM Product's security has been compromised, 
owners of Secure Content ("Secure Content 
Owners") may request that Microsoft revoke 
the WM-DRM Product's right to copy, display 
and/or play Secure Content. Revocation does 
not alter the WM-DRM Product's ability to 
play unprotected content. A list of revoked 
WM-DRM Product is sent to your Workstation 
Computer whenever you download a license for 
Secure Content from the Internet. Microsoft 
may, in conjunction with such license, also 
download revocation lists onto your 
Workstation Computer on behalf of Secure 
Content Owners. Secure Content Owners may 
also require you to upgrade some of the WM-
DRM components in this Product ('WM-DRM 
Upgrades') before accessing their content. 
When you attempt to play such content, WM-DRM 
Product built by Microsoft will notify you 
that a WM-DRM Upgrade is required and then 
ask for your consent before the WM-DRM 
Upgrade is downloaded. WM-DRM software built 
by third parties may do the same. If you 
decline the upgrade, you will not be able to 
access content that requires the WM-DRM 
Upgrade; however, you will still be able to 
access unprotected content and Secure Content 
that does not require the upgrade. WM-DRM 
features that access the Internet, such as 
acquiring new licenses and/or performing a 
required WM-DRM Upgrade, can be switched off. 
When these features are switched off, you 
will still be able to play Secure Content if 
you have a valid license for such content 
already stored on your Workstation Computer.

 * Consent to Use of Data. You agree that 
Microsoft and its affiliates may collect and 
use technical information gathered in any 
manner as part of the product support 
services provided to you, if any, related to 
the Product. Microsoft may use this 
information solely to improve our products or 
to provide customized services or 
technologies to you. Microsoft may disclose 
this information to others, but not in a form 
that personally identifies you. 

 * Internet Gaming/Update Features. If you 
choose to utilize the Internet gaming or 
update features within the Product, it is 
necessary to use certain computer system, 
hardware, and software information to 
implement the features. By using these 
features, you explicitly authorize Microsoft 
or its designated agent to access and utilize 
the necessary information for Internet gaming 
and/or updating purposes. Microsoft may use 
this information solely to improve our 
products or to provide customized services or 
technologies to you. Microsoft may disclose
